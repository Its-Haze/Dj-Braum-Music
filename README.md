  Read more about virtual environments here [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html)
- To run this bot 24/7 I recommend using a [raspberry pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (Non affiliate link)
- Do not run this bot on Replit, Heroku and such.. they will give you more headache.
